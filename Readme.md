This function is run with the Dataset provided in:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

It must be decompressed as default or renamed 'Dataset' in the working directory.
The function is run by calling run_analysis() and will return the final object as well as save it as a table called tidyData.txt.

If you need to test the directory outside working directory, then specify the path as run_analysis("./wherevever").

Haven't tested it ouside the working directory's nested folder so try if you can to include the data within.
